A simple NLP project demonstrating how to preprocess text data and convert it into a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation using Python and NLTK.

---

## 📌 What This Notebook Covers

* Load Restaurant_Reviews.tsv dataset
* Clean and preprocess text using regex, stopwords, and tokenization
* Build a Bag-of-Words model
* Convert text into numerical form for machine-learning tasks
* Explore basic NLP workflow using Pandas + NLTK

## 📁 Files

* `bow23.ipynb` — notebook with preprocessing + BoW steps
* `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv` — input dataset (expected)

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas nltk
```

Also download NLTK stopwords if needed:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")
```
